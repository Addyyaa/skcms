      "message": "Yes, I prefer the separate struct. I had to go back and make sure I remembered how this worked - the mirror B2A struct does encapsulate the possible set of operations of both mft and BtoA tags. (At one point I was picturing a single tag that represented the union of mft, AtoB, and BtoA, but that\u0027s just messy. This definitely looks like the cleanest solution.",
