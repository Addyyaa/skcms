      "message": "The structure was different, yes; with one-big-switch you do inline into one enormous function, but you are still paying the cost of an indirect jump since the switch is going to use a lookup table (plus the indirection is harder to predict, I suspect, because `lookup_table[op++]` is more involved than `*stages++`). \n\nI honestly don\u0027t think the switch-branching cost should be any different than a function call cost, assuming reasonable codegen, but it is possible that function calls will stack-spill in different ways that the switch did. Perf might not match its original levels; it could be better or it could be worse. It\u0027s hard to know for sure without trying it. I tested this locally and on my cloudtop, and the performance seemed very close to the timings from http://review.skia.org/784541 , but the platforms that we actually care about (RISC-V, Android 32, Windows) aren\u0027t ones that I can easily bench, and each one has unique codegen foibles. I think we should land and look at the actual numbers; if they are bad, I\u0027ll reassess.",
