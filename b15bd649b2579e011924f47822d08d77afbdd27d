      "message": "Overall looks good. My quick thoughts about the open questions:\n\n- Choosing render intents is tough, given how we\u0027ve split up source and dest. Ideally you\u0027d negotiate between both profiles to decide which one to use - being able to round-trip in a single profile is less important than using the same A2B from source as B2A from dest, I\u0027d think? To that end, I think we either:\n  1) Just offer the one set of priorities used for both tags, as any particular profile is really only used as either src or dst. Let clients deal with profile pairs and a policy for prioritizing their src choices after they\u0027ve picked a dst?\n  2) Go all the way, inflate skcs_Profile to include the parsed tags for all rendering intents, and defer the decision so we can line things up in skcms_Transform.\n\n- At this point, MakeUsableAsDestinationWithSingleCurve really means - \"MakeUsableForSkiaRasterization\". I think we can keep the naming, but I tend to think having a valid B2A should qualify as usable as destination. If we\u0027re going to this trouble, we may as well try to adhere to 8.10.2 (always use A2B and B2A if present).",

      "message": "I agree that profiles tend to be used as src xor dst, which I think means what I\u0027ve got here will be fine in practice.  And if you really want both directions with different priorities you can always call skcms_Parse() twice.\n\nI think I agree that we should prefer B2A if present and that MakeUsableForDestination() should allow B2A while MakeUsableAsDestinationWithSingleCurve() shouldn\u0027t unless we add B2A support to Skia.\n\nBut I might flip each of those policies from conservative no-change to what-we-ideally-want in separate CLs so we can isolate any downstream fallout from each change.  Using B2A at all even as a backup is probably also a policy to isolate in its own change.",
