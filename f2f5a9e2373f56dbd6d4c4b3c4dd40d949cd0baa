      "message": "In the Skia repo, we often (maybe 1/6 of upgrades) see differences either in Gold or Perf when we do OS upgrades. Having a CL on the blamelist makes it very easy to determine the reason. Otherwise it just looks like flakes while we\u0027re rolling out the upgrade and any changes get blamed on a random CL.\n\nIt\u0027s possible that this has become less of an issue for non-NativeFonts bots in the Skia repo, but I don\u0027t have enough evidence.\n\nIf skcms only has unit tests or you don\u0027t care about the above issues, it\u0027s fine to change this to just os:Mac.",
